      Hello, world

          Basic: Top-level function, (Packages classes), Kotlin has no statics

          Object-Oriented: Class, Function, Constructor, Property, String template

      Beans and Data classes

          Declaring properties in primary constructors (User bean)

          Data classes (Point class)

              Multi-declarations / Returning many things from a function

              Iterating a list with indices

              Iterating a map

      Basic functions & Parameters

          Default arguments (makeString/join)

          Named parameters ( - " - )

          Vararg parameters (listOf())

          -- Multiple return values

          Motivation
              We all LOVE utility classes, don't we?! (Show StringUtil from Apache commons)
                  If your project doesn't have a StringUtil, be honest â€” it does!

              Let's pretend that we have Lambdas in Java and look at Guava (transform(filter(list, {}) {}))
                  My, it's BACKWARDS

              And how do I find that method I need?
                  By Ctlr+Space, _if it is a member_!

              It would be so cool to just add a method to that class/interface!
                  In Java 8 you can, _if you own the class/interface_
                  Prior to Java 8 you couldn't add a method to a public interface

          Extensions
              In Kotlin you DO NOT exactly add methods to classes you don't own

              You write _extensions_ and call them as if they were methods
                  Limitation: extensions are not virtual (you can not override one)

                  Simple Example: File.write

                  Collection processing: filter / map VS Guava

              Java 8 extensions vs Kotlin extensions

              More:
                  Extensions enable fluent APIs
                  Extensions enable conventions
                  Extensions enable enhanced Java APIs

      Fighting NPEs
          File.listFiles()
          NPE on something from a list
          Java annotations / KAnnotator / Smart casts
